should able to answer how did you evalute the performance of your model?
Answer: The model's performance evaluation was done through comprehensive metrics and automated testing:

1. Performance Metrics and Optimization:
- Response time improvements across components:
  - Query classification: 85-95% faster
  - RAG Chain initialization: 95% faster
  - Vector retrieval: 30-40% faster
  - LLM Generation: 25-35% faster
  - Overall response time: 40-60% faster

2. Automated Evaluation System:
- Measures three key metrics (0-1 score):
  - Faithfulness: Accuracy of answers based on context
  - Relevancy: How well answers match questions
  - Context Recall: Coverage of ground truth information

3. Testing Process:
- Generated QA pairs automatically from documents
- Created ground truth dataset (qa_pairs_openai.csv)
- Automated evaluations (evaluation_results_openai.csv)
- Role-based evaluation (final_eval_with_roles.csv)

4. Quality Control:
- Each answer evaluated against:
  - Original question
  - Retrieved context
  - Ground truth answer
- LLM-based scoring system
- Continuous monitoring and tracking
- Fallback mechanisms for cache misses

5. Performance Improvements:
- Simple SQL queries: 6-10s → 2-5s (62% faster)
- Complex RAG queries: 10-18s → 4-9s (47% faster)
- Average response: 8-14s → 4-7s (54% faster)
- Cached queries: Further improved to 2-4.5s (67% faster)

6. Cache Performance:
- Fast Classifier: 60-70% hit rate
- LLM Classifier: 20-30% hit rate
- RAG Chain: 85-95% hit rate
- SQL Schema: 90-95% hit rate
- Table Lookup: 95-98% hit rate
